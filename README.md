# Raspberry PinWeb
## _Control GPIO pin's output via web interface, lan api or telegram bot_

This is a simple web app that allows you to switch on/off GPIO pins using webpage or additional telegram bot. Also wide schedule or temperature/humidity triggers can be used (yes, it supports dht11/21/22 sensor). All this easy to set up in comfortable  admin web-panel. Supports English and Russian language.
## Features
- Set up pins (name, ordering, etc.) and control them remotely from lan
- Set up telegram bot (just token and your id) and control pins form anywhere
- Set up sheduled pin tasks in admin panel and enable-disable them remotely 
- Connect dht sensor to gpio4 (board7) and see actual data and set up pin tasks

All this features (exept basic web app and api) can be easy disabled in settings if you don't need them.

## Installation
Tested on PiZero, Pi4B (Raspbian OS) and PC (Ubuntu 20.04)
```
cd ~/
wget https://github.com/nallan-dev/PinWeb/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
rm master.zip
mv PinWeb-master/ PinWeb
cd PinWeb
```

PinWeb requires to run just python3,7+ and some pip-libraries.

```sudo apt update```
```sudo apt install python3-pip```
```apt-get install python3-venv```

With some extras for paspberry pi:
- for pins and DHT sensor support:
```sudo apt install pigpio python-pigpio python3-pigpio```

Make venv then install the python dependencies and start the app:
(if you want to test this app on PC - use python3.7+_requirements_PC.txt)

```
python3 -m venv ../pin_web_env
source ../pin_web_env/bin/activate
pip install -r python3.7+_requirements_Pi.txt
```

Then check settings, set up appropriate for you:

```
nano main/settings.py
```

If you test this app on PC, don't forget to set FAKE_GPIO to True.
Then save changes, close settings.py (cntrl+o, then cntrl+x for nano)
And start the app (may take several seconds to start):

```
python run_app.py
```
If you see message like:
Django version 3.1.5, using settings 'main.settings'
Starting development server at http://0.0.0.0:8080/

So app is working and you can check it  with browser.
To stop app push cntrl+c keyboard interrupt (maybe several times)
Admin panel - User admin password 123454321
## Run app as service

Open systemctl sample:
```
nano systemctl_samples/PinWeb.service
```
Make sure that params WorkingDirectory and ExecStart is valid for your folders.
For virtual enviroment it must looks like:
ExecStart=/home/pi/pin_web_env/bin/python run_app.py

If all correct, then:

```
sudo cp systemctl_samples/PinWeb.service /etc/systemd/system/PinWeb.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
Now you can control this app like:
sudo systemctl enable PinWeb  # add to autostart on boot
sudo systemctl start PinWeb
sudo systemctl stop PinWeb
sudo systemctl restart PinWeb
sudo systemctl disable PinWeb  # remove from autostart after boot
sudo systemctl status PinWeb

Restart required after any changes in settings.py or changing bot token via admin panel.

## Api

It's very simple - you can get all information about configured pins (and schedules etc.) in JSON by GET '/get_report' url. To make action just send POST to '/' with data:
- state=1 (or 0) pin state and
- board_num=int (pin board num);
or
- state=1 (or 0) state and
- sched_id=int (schedule task id);
or
- state=1 (or 0) state and
- temper_id=int (sensor task id).

POST action returns in response renewed JSON same as '/get_report'

The end
